# Mail Tracking Service System

This is an email tracking service that allows you to monitor opens and clicks on email campaigns. The application allows you to create and manage campaigns, send emails to subscriber lists, track interactions with templates, and view campaign statistics. The front-end is built with React.js, and the back-end is powered by Laravel and PHP.

## üìã Features

- Campaign Management: Create, view, and delete email campaigns.
- Email Lists: Create and manage email lists of subscribers.
- Subscribers: Manage subscribers, including the ability to add, edit, and remove them.
- Email Tracking: Track email opens and click activity.
- Email Templates: Create and customize email templates for campaigns.
- Campaign Statistics: View open and click rates for each campaign.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Laravel (PHP): Backend to manage the system, user authentication, and business logic.
- React.js: Frontend for user interaction.
- SQLite: Database used to store data locally.
- Tailwind CSS: CSS framework for styling.
- Inertia.js: Framework for integration between Laravel backend and React frontend.
- SQLite: Relational database for storing campaign data, email lists, and subscriber information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts

- Authentication Middleware: Ensures only authorized users can access campaign data.
- Factories & Seeders: Used for generating and seeding test data (campaigns, subscribers).
- Controllers: Handle campaign logic and interactions.
- Models: Represent database tables and relationships (e.g., Campaign, Subscriber).
- Queues & Jobs: Queue background tasks like sending emails and tracking events to improve performance.
